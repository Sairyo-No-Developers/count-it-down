# Count It Down

What are you waiting for? Count it down!
## Overview

Welcome to our Web App! We created this using React and JavaScript. Here you can enter any date and time from future and start a countdown up to that time. Once started this will keep showing time left until the end or can be reset at any time. 

## Dev Stack Used

- React
- Sass
- Node.js

## Setup And Use In Local Machine

It's a simple frontend app made with React. We just have to install the packages and run a development server using react-scripts.

```sh
npm ci
npm start
```
For producing an optimized build, use
```sh
npm run build
```
## Our Targeted Goals

- [x] Create a minimal dark theme design using Sass.
- [ ] Multiple Countdown system.
- [ ] Setting notifications and toasts when a countdown ends.
- [ ] Custom background and theme selection for user.
